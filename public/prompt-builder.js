The JSON object must have three keys: "explanation", "definitions", and an optional "visualAssets".

1.  In the "explanation" value, provide a detailed, non-generic explanation of the topic with at least 2 paragraphs. **For any mathematical equations or variables, you MUST enclose them in LaTeX delimiters. Use $ for inline math (e.g., Let $x$ be a variable) and $$ for display math (e.g., $$E = mc^2$$).**
2.  In the "definitions" value, provide an array of objects. For each object, identify a technical term from your explanation and provide a simple, one-sentence definition for it in the context of the topic. Only add/define these technical terms if they are truly technical and not straightforward, and their definition is specific to the context. Terms like focus, endurance, mental toughness which are not included.
3.  In the "visualAssets" value, (this key is optional), analyze your explanation. If a visual aid would enhance understanding, add this key. If not, OMIT this key entirely.If you include a visual reference (timeline or graph equation) feel free to refer in your "explanation" content directly to them. Do not add a timeline if it isn't really helpful and really makes sense to have it there. 
    * If included, it must be an array of objects. Each object represents one visual asset.
    * For each asset, provide a "type" and "data".

Here are the available asset types and their required data formats:
* **For a function graph (e.g., for math equations):**
    * "type": "implicit_plotter"
    * "data": (String) A single string with one or more equations separated by semicolons (e.g., "y=x^2; y=sin(x)"). The equation here should be plain text, NOT in LaTeX format.
* **For a timeline (for historical events, periods, or both):**
    * "type": "hybrid_timeline"
    * "data": (Array of Objects) An array of items. Each item must have a "type" key ('period' or 'event').
        * If type is 'period', include "name", "startStr", and "endStr".
        * If type is 'event', include "name" and "dateStr".
* **For a bar chart:**
    * "type": "bar_chart"
    * "data": (String) A multi-line string with each line in "Label: Value" format.
* **For a pie chart:**
    * "type": "pie_chart"
    * "data": (String) A multi-line string with each line in "Label: Percentage" format.`;

In case b, you are asked about a topic in more abstract terms like "iranian history since 1800" or "chinese diplomacy". In this case your task is to design a unique syllabus for the topic "${topic}" for a "${sophistication}" audience.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with NO other text before or after it.Do NOT use unescaped newline characters.
The JSON object must have two required keys ("category", "syllabus") and one optional key ("visualAssets").

1.  **"category"**: Categorize this topic into ONE of the following predefined categories: ${categories.join(', ')}.
2.  **"syllabus"**: In case a, write a syllabus with 6-12 modules, which together are MECE. In case b, Design a syllabus as a numbered list of 4-8 unique and compelling module titles for the topic. In both cases this value must be a single string. The modules should be specific to the topic and in case b, not generic at all. Provide only the titles. Avoid generic titles like "Introduction" or "Key Concepts.", 'historical context'.
3.  **"visualAssets" (Optional)**:
    * **IF the topic's category is NOT "Science" or "Mathematics"** and is inherently historical and best understood chronologically, you MAY include this key. If you choose to include it, make it detailed e.g. aim for 9-10 events/periods, though more if the topic demands it. For instance if asked about chinese imperial history make sure to include all the dynasties, not just some.
    * **IF the topic's category IS "Science" or "Mathematics", OMIT this key entirely.**
    * If included, it MUST be an array containing a single object for a timeline.If you include a visual reference (timeline or graph equation) feel free to refer in your "explanation" content directly to them.
    * The object's "type" MUST be "hybrid_timeline".
    * The object's "data" MUST be an array of event and/or period objects covering the topic's key milestones. An event must have a single date (e.g. a year) - if it spans more than 1 year or 1 date it should be classified as a period.
        * An event requires "name" and "dateStr".
        * A period requires "name", "startStr", and "endStr".

Example for a history topic:

  "syllabus": "1. The Achaemenid Empire\\n2. Parthian and Sasanian Eras\\n3. The Islamic Golden Age in Persia",

USER'S REQUEST: "${userPrompt}"

--- YOUR TASK & RULES ---

1.  **Analyze Request Type:** The user's request might be **descriptive** (e.g., 'a sine wave from 0 to 10') or **interpretive** (e.g., 'a supply and demand curve' or 'an elasticity curve'). For descriptive requests you should be unfailingly accurate. For interpretive requests, you MUST generate appropriate, illustrative data and the corresponding chart structure.

2.  **Output Format:**
  * Your response MUST be ONLY a single JavaScript code block, wrapped in \`\`\`javascript ... \`\`\`.
  * Do NOT include any other text, explanations, or conversation before or after the code block.
  * The code must be self-contained and ready to run.

3.  **Code Structure:**
  * The code MUST define a new chart instance using \`new Chart(ctx, { ... });\`.
  * It should accept a canvas context object named \`ctx\`.
  * The code must be complete, including the chart \`type\`, \`data\` object, and \`options\` object.

4.  **Critical Guardrail Rules:**
  * **Axis Boundary Rule:** For common economic graphs (like Supply/Demand, PPF, etc.) that exist only in the first quadrant, ensure lines do NOT render below zero. Data points should meet the axes, not cross them. To enforce this, set \`min: 0\` on both the x and y axes scales in the chart options.
  * **Data Generation Rule:** For interpretive requests, generate your own logical data. For example, a supply curve must have a positive slope, and a demand curve must have a negative slope. For a sine wave, generate the points using a loop.
  * **Clarity Rule:** Add concise comments to your code explaining the data structure and key configuration options.
  * **Labeling Rule:** Always provide clear, descriptive labels for the chart title (using the plugins.title option), axes (x and y), and each dataset.
